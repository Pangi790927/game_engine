- the makefile gets all the depends required to use the engine and builds them
if necesary
- use make clean to clear all extern modules
- modules will have an interface header that will be used to include that module
headers and makefile.extern.OSTYPE that will be used to link those libs where
OSTYPE can be macos, linux or win32 and to build them if necesary
- extern libs will also stay here as libname_if.h because often we need to
enforce strict include ordering and all kinds of strange include macros that
we don't want to care about inside of the engine
